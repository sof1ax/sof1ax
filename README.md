## Hi there, I am Sofia
If you’re reading this, I’m probably hunched over my laptop like this.

## About me
I’m a developer with a background in Management Information Systems, combining analytical thinking with hands-on software development.

I enjoy building across the stack — creating thoughtful user experiences on the frontend and developing the logic that powers them behind the scenes. I care about clarity, structure, and building things that feel intuitive and reliable.

Curiosity drives me. What started in analytics evolved into a deeper interest in engineering — understanding how systems connect and how ideas turn into real, working applications.

Currently building full-stack projects and committed to becoming a well-rounded engineer.

Always learning. Always building. :shipit:
